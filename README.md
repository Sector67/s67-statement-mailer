Sector 67 Mailer Robot
======================

This script is a _very_ simple single page app that sends emails based on a csv file that is uploaded by the user with each use.


To begin using it:

<ol>
 <li>download a copy</li>
 <li>create a config.php file in the root directory with two variables:
    <ul>
    - $USERNAME
    - $PASSWORD
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>visit index.html and everything should work :)</li>
</ol>
